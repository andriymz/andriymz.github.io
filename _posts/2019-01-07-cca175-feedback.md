In this post I'm sharing some information you may find useful about the [CA175](https://www.cloudera.com/about/training/certification/cca-spark.html) certification exam I took recently.

## Exam structure

Before taking the exam, I would suggest you to read some feedback posts from [IT Versity](http://discuss.itversity.com). The majority of exams had 2 questions on Sqoop and 7/8 questions on Spark (including mine).

Even though the certification page contains "Ingest real-time and near-real-time streaming data into HDFS" and "Process streaming data as it is loaded onto the cluster" as required skills, I didn't find any single feedback where someone had a question on Flume or Spark Streaming.

The exam structure changed in 2017 and there are no longer any Scala or Python fill-in-the-blank templates on Spark questions. You will have to write your solutions from scratch and execute them in the spark-shell.

## Environment

You will have access to a machine similar to the [Cloudera QuickStart VM](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-13.html). Make yourself comfortable working with this environment.


## Preparation

Finally, following the two blogs below and being able to quickly solve all of the provided exercises will be more than enough to get the certification.
